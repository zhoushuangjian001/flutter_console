# Elaborate

After completing the development of the App program, it will enter the testing phase. Testers need to check the log status of specific locations in the App program. However, these logs are output to the debugging console of the IDE, and the testers do not use the IDE, which brings great inconvenience to the testing work. To solve this problem, Fd_Console came into being. Developers only need to introduce Fd_Console into the project and use the log method it provides in the corresponding location. Testers can view the program log output without relying on the IDE. In addition, Fd_Console also solves the problems of insufficient log filtering rules in the Android Studio debugging console and the inability to easily clear logs in the VsCode debugging console with one click.
